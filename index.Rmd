title: "Introduction to R"
---

R is an open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. R is extensible, and has a large collection of high-quality user contributed packages that makes data analysis easy for beginners. This mini-course will introduce you the fundamentals of R programming with a focus on data management, data visualization and quantitative finance applications in R.

#### What To Prepare

Please install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) before the first session. If you encounter technical difficulties installing the software, you can instead create a free [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account so you can run R in the cloud via your browser.

An alternative to RStudio Cloud is the new UofT JupyterHub/RStudio system. Go to its [home page](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/login), choose the *RStudio* option, and click "*Log in to start*". You will need your UTORid to login. Currently, the UofT JupyterHub/RStudio service is a proof-of-concept installation so it is possible that you experience some minor issues.
